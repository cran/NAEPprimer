\title{M36NT2PM.dat - data file in the NAEP Primer data set}
\format{The .dat files are in a fixed width dat file. The format is described by the .fr2 files.}
\description{
The NAEP Primer is designed to simplify access to the NAEP database and make
its technologies more user-friendly in NAEP data analysis. The Primer data
contain a random mini-sample of real data from the 2005 grade 8 mathematics
assessment that have been approved for public use. Only public schools are
included in this subsample that contains selected variables for about 10 percent
of the schools and students in this assessment. All students who participated
in NAEP in the selected public schools are included. The mini-sample contains
assessment data for students (assessed and excluded), as well as questionnaire
data for teachers and schools. It has one combined data file with student data,
teacher data, and school data at the student level. This mini-sample is not
sufficient to make state comparisons. In addition, to ensure confidentiality,
no state, school, or student identifiers are included (see The NAEP Primer
(NCES 2011463) for further information).

\details{
Together M36NT2PM.dat and M36NC2PM.dat are the data for the NAEP Primer--for
students and schools, respectively. The files M36NT2PM.fr2 M36NC2PM.fr2
are the layout files for the same data.

Traditionally the NAEP Primer would be a single file but for exposition purposes we have split it up into a 
M36NT2PM.dat contains 300 variables and 17606 rows, and has the majority of student, teacher, and school data.
M36NC2PM.dat contains 2 variables and 4092 rows (one per school), and has two school variables. 
The two school variables on M36NC2PM are:

\itemize{
 \item{"SSCRPSU"}{Scrambled PSU and school code (used for linking)}
 \item{"C052601"}{Percent enrolled in math for remediation}
